# TabReminder
Initial commit

There are times when we need to open a web page on a regular basis. And there are times when we forget about them. In order to minimize the times we miss opening those tabs, havee this extension installed on your Firefox browser.

You get a nice UI to save the URL you want to open, the date and time you want to open it and how frequently this should be repeated. You also get to view all the saved site in a tabular form where you get to edit/delete the saved sites.
